# ETL-Homework

## Baseball Hall of Fame


### There are some important instructions before you get started which you will follow along in the players_etl jupyter notebook.

### Quick Overview:

1. Open PostgreSQL and create the tables.
2. Extract the CSV files.
3. Transform the data (by using panda and dataframes and cleaning!).
4. Load the dataframes into the tables and database you've already created.
5. Run a couple queries to confirm the data loaded successfully.

## There are some important instructions before you get started which you will follow along in the players_etl jupyter notebook.

## Quick Overview:

1. Open the jupyter notebook file (**players_etl.ipynb**).
1. Follow the instructions at the top of the jupyter notebook to create the database and tables. Including the instructions here as well.
    1. Open PostgreSQL.
    1. Create a database called players_db.
    1. Open a Query Tool and locate a file called schema.sql found in the Resources folder.
    1. Run the queries to create the two tables (players and hall_of_fame).
1. Make sure you have entered your username and password in your config.py file.
1. Extract the CSV files.
1. Transform the data (by using panda and dataframes and cleaning!).
1. Load the dataframes into the tables and database you've already created.
1. Run a couple queries to confirm the data loaded successfully.

## Bonus:
If you would like to see some results from the data in the tables, make note of the last instruction in the jupyter notebook. There is a **queries.sql** file available to run a few queries on the data.
